	Remove Inactive Mailboxes
This script will remove inactive mailboxes from Office 365 that are being held onto by an Exchange retention policy
The retention compliance policy holds on to mailboxes after the user is removed. This script specifically 
exempts these mailboxes from that organization hold with this switch -ExcludeFromOrgHolds "<38 character GUID starting with MBX>"
To find hold GUID: Get-OrganizationConfig |fl inplace*
Compare to Get-RetentionCompliancePolicy | fl name,*id*
Update line 42 with correct GUID
The script then removes delay holds from the mailboxes so that they are removed at the next opportunity by Microsoft's processes

What this script does not do is deal with ComplianceTag holds. These are retention tags set in https://protection.office.com/retentionlabels
Any existing tags are capable of applying a longer retention on a mailbox item, and thus the mailbox. 
These should be found using a Content Search and the retention tag changed or removed from there.


Prerequisites:
Must have Exchange Online admin access
Must have powershell module: ExchangeOnlineShell
	Find-module ExchangeOnlineShell | install-module

##  Connect to Office 365
Connect-ExchangeOnlineShell


##  Declare script variables. Gather inactive mailboxes without compliance tag hold, then grab just the 35 days and older users
$allInactiveMBX = get-mailbox -InactiveMailboxOnly -ResultSize unlimited | where {$_.ComplianceTagHoldApplied -ne "true"}
write-host $allInactiveMBX.count "inactive mailboxes found"
$OldUserObjects = $allInactiveMBX | where {$_.WhenSoftDeleted -lt ((Get-Date).AddDays(-35)).Date}
write-host $OldUserObjects.count "mailboxes older than 35 days old"
$Users = $OldUserObjects | select -ExpandProperty identity

##  Loop through each mauilbox and removes holds. This will likely output 1 or more lines saying applied but not modified
Foreach ($u in $Users){
write-host "Processing user" $u
set-mailbox -Identity $u -InactiveMailbox -RemoveDelayHoldApplied:$true -Confirm:$false -Force
set-mailbox -Identity $u -InactiveMailbox -RemoveDelayReleaseHoldApplied:$true -Confirm:$false -Force
set-mailbox -Identity $u -InactiveMailbox -ExcludeFromOrgHolds "<GUID>" -Confirm:$false -Force
}
